# Installing

The Breez SDK is available in the following platforms:

## Android

We recommend integrating the Breez SDK as Gradle dependency from [our Maven repository](https://mvn.breez.technology/releases).

To do so, add the following to your Gradle dependencies:

```gradle
repositories {
  maven {
      url("https://mvn.breez.technology/releases")
  }
}

dependencies {
  implementation("breez_sdk:bindings-android:<version>")
}
```

## iOS

We recommend using our official Swift package: [breez/breez-sdk-swift](https://github.com/breez/breez-sdk-swift).

## React Native

We recommmend using the official npm package:

```console
$ npm install https://github.com/breez/breez-sdk-react-native/releases/download/0.1.2/breeztech-react-native-breez-sdk-0.1.2.tgz
```
or
```console
$ yarn add https://github.com/breez/breez-sdk-react-native/releases/download/0.1.2/breeztech-react-native-breez-sdk-0.1.2.tgz
```

## Go

We recommend using our official Go package: [breez/breez-sdk-go](https://github.com/breez/breez-sdk-go).

```console
$ go get github.com/breez/breez-sdk-go
```

## C#

Currently c# is built from source only. Please visit the [sdk-bindings](https://github.com/breez/breez-sdk/tree/main/libs/sdk-bindings#c) project for instructions.

## rust

Currently rust is still not accessible via cargo and is needed to be built from source. Please visit the [sdk-core](https://github.com/breez/breez-sdk/tree/main/libs/sdk-core) project for instructions.

## Dart/Flutter
Currently Dart is built from source only. Please visit the [sdk-flutter](https://github.com/breez/breez-sdk/tree/main/libs/sdk-flutter#readme) project for instructions. We're planning to publish this package to [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/), until then it needs to be specified as a local directory dependency.

```yaml
dependencies:
  breez_sdk:
    path: <relative-path-to>/breez-sdk/libs/sdk-flutter
```
## Python

Currently python is not acceable as a package and is needed to build it from source. Please visit [sdk-core](https://github.com/breez/breez-sdk/tree/main/libs/sdk-bindings#python) project for instructions.
